# 7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.

We can see that the highest-rated applications are total **free**.
We also see that 5 of them are social networks, counting *Pandora* and *Spotify*. From this data, we could say that social networks are more useful to connect with people far away and we value them more.

The 4 remaining applications are video games, where people are more likely to give their opinion about them.

And finally, the most surprising, is the Bible, understanding that believers are grateful and like to spread everything they like or believe.

# 8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.
In question 6 We can see that 9 of the 10 applications with the best score belong to the category of games.

# 9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?
We can see a difference between both questions.
On the first question, social networks had the majority of the top 10 apps most rated and the second one has a majority in games as best-rated apps.
We can see now that people tend to vote higher on apps they enjoy their free time while social networks are considered as time losing.

# 11. Does people care about the price?
Absolutely yes, We can see that the apps between 0.99 and 1.99 can easily be bought but when the price increases the reviews drops drastically
